The application is made entirely with JavaScript.
Even the visual part of the calculator is created with JavaScript so index.html file is empty. 
Just click the link and try it out.
When there is no value entered, clicking "=" button makes the output area border red to warn user that something is wrong with their calculations. Similarily, no more than one decimal dot can be placed in the number, they go red to demonstrate the user that something is wrong.
JS 'eval()' method in use.
Calculator works with basic functions '+', "-", '*', '/'.
